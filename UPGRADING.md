Some versions has breaking changes. if you want to upgrade **laravel-formula** version to latest and don't break a current behavior, you need to use this upgrade guide.

## From v0.* to v1.0

- the name of installation class has changed from `InstallerConfig` to `Install`.
  If you use default class name and location please change it to `Install`.
- constructor parameter signature for `Executor` contract changed from `$installCommand` to `$artisanCommand`. If you implement it with custom class, change constructor parameter signature.

## From v1.* to v2.*

This update doesn't affect most users if you haven't override formula classes. If you have, checkout next breaking changes:

- `Executor` class and contract removed, only `Runner` contract and class left
- `Runner` contract changed. If you are implementing this interface manually, you should adopt your implementation.
- Renamed `project.installer` and `project.updater` service container abstractions to `app.installer` and `app.updater`

Also default formula stubs updated, you may copy new content.
